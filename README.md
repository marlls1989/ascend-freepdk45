This is a distribution for the ASCEnD-freePDK45 library, developed over the North Carolina State University (NCSU) open source predictive Process Design Kit (PDK) FreePDK 45nm (bulk CMOS). The library supports the design of asynchronous circuits. ASCEnD stands for "Asynchronous Standard Cells for 'n' Designs". The asynchronous design templates supported by the library are from the quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) class, all based on the Null Convention Logic (NCL) paradigm. On top of this paradigm, the library developers propose, besides conventional NCL gates, an additional set of gates with behavior dual to NCL, the NCL+ (or NCLP) gates [8]. The library contains NCL gates as well as NCL+ gates and inverted versions of both these gate types (INCL and INCLP).

ASCEnD-freePDK45 was designed as a stand-alone cell library. Although using the same PDK as the Silvaco 45nm Open Cell Library (previously called Nangate Open Cell Library, available at https://www.silvaco.com/products/nangate/FreePDK45_Open_Cell_Library/) these libraries are not compatible. We found the original Open Cell Library characteristics to be quite limiting to the overall quality of cells and decided it was not worth to keep compatibility with it, given the implied costs.

The ASCEnD-freePDK45 library contains a total of 134 cells: 34 NCL gates, 28 NCL+ gates (NCLP), inverted versions of several of these gates (22 INCL cells and 16 INCLP cells), totalizing 100 cells. The remaining 34 cells comprise 13 asymmetrical C-elements, 12 gates with Set and/or Reset control pins (for implementing NCL registers), 4 layout support cells (a Fill, a Fill Tie, a Pull-up and a Pull-down cell), 3 mutexes, an XOR and an XNOR gate. Where relevant, cells employ a Sutherland transistor topology (also called Static topology). Most cell types are available in 3 drive strengths: X1, X2 and X4. The exact number of drives is cell-type dependent.

Among the 134 cells, there are exactly 55 distinct cell types: 12 NCL cell types, 10 NCLP cell types, 9 INCL cell types and 7 INCLP cell types. The remaining 17 cell types comprise 5 asymmetrical C-element types (1 with one common input, 2 with reset control and 1 or 2 common inputs and 2 with set control and 1 or 2 common inputs), 4 types of C-elements with set and/or reset control input(s), the 4 layout support cell types, 2 mutex cell types, the XOR and XNOR cell types.

This release of ASCEnD-freePDK45 is distributed in seven folders:<br>
.<br>
|-- doc<br>
|-- gds<br>
|-- lef<br>
|-- lib<br>
|-- netlist<br>
|-- oa<br>
|-- verilog<br>

The folder ./doc contains the datasheets for every cell in the library, in html format, for every chracterization corner (see more below). Note that in the current library release the area field of the cells is not valid, all of these fields are zeroed. Providing this information in the cell datasheet is future work. Also in the ./doc folder there are 5 documentational text files: inverter_cells.txt, lef_list.txt, lib_list.txt, ncl_cells.txt and nclp_cells.txt. These files are not used at all for synthesis or layout generation. 

The ./gds folder contains all cell layouts. 

The ./lef folder provides the cell abstract views (pin locations and metal layers blocks). 

The ./lib folder furnishes the cell characterization data in a machine readable format (.lib). 

The ./netlist folder contains the cell transistor schematics as Spice descriptions, including transistor sizing data. 

The ./oa folder contains layout information in the open access format. 

Finally, the ./verilog folder contains the behavioral cell descriptions.

The library ASCEnD-freePDK45 comes with characterization data for three corners: NOM (Nominal 1.10V, 25C), SS (Slow-Slow 0.95V, 125C) and FF (Fast-Fast 1.25V, 0C). Separate .lib and .html files are accordingly available for each of the corners and about every cell, where applicable.

ATTENTION: The ASCEnD-freePDK45 is originally an internal development of the GAPH research group to support our SDDS-NCL logic template [7], derived from NCL but essentially distinct from the latter. As such, we employ the concept of virtual functions [4,5] that enable using conventional synthesis tools to generate and optimize NCL circuits (see e.g. our SDDS-NCL page at https://corfu.pucrs.br/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=SDDS-NCL). Besides, the design of sequential SDDS-NCL circuits requires the use of special characterization procedures and models [3,2,1]. As a consequence, pure NCL design with our cells, although possible, may require some re-characterization of the library. Please contact us to find out how to conduct this process. Another consequence is that some data from our library may have to be overlooked during pure NCL design, such as the dummy clock pin G, present in the datasheet of cells used to build registers [3,2]. These pins do not physically exist, but are used during circuit modeling and synthesis.

Still regarding the relationship between the ASCEnD-freePDK45 library and NCL design, it is usual that NCL designers rely on the original library proposed by Theseus Inc. in the 90's, containing 27 threshold gates. Out of these, ASCEnD-freePDK45 provides 11 gate types, but does not contain any of the other 16 NCL gate types of the Theseus Inc. library (all of these, with one exception, are 4-input gates that are not quite useful for low power applications, for example). On the other hand, ASCEnD-freePDK45 provides 28 cell types not available in the Theseus Inc. library, plus another 17 non-NCL cell types to make more flexible the design process.

It is necessary to point out here to the way the behavior of sequential gates (most of the library gates in ASCEnD-freePDK45 fall in this category) is described in characterization and datasheets. Due to the threshold with hysteresis behavior of most NCL/NCLP gates, three Boolean functions are necessary to fully describe their operation:
  - The ON-set, a function that is '1' when the gate is expected to force '1' in its output, and is '0' otherwise.
  - The OFF-set, a function that is '1' when the gate is expected to force '0' in its output, and is '0' otherwise.
  - The HOLD-set, a function that is '1' when the gate is expected to keep its output unchanged and is '0' otherwise.

Traditional design tools (e.g. those from Cadence or Synopsys frameworks) manipulate gate behaviors based on a single Boolean function. Given this, and considering the threshold with hysteresis behavior of NCL/NCLP gates, the ASCEnD-freePDK45 characterization data provides a single Boolean function to represent the "activation function" of the gate, merging the three functions in specific ways, as explained in references [1] to [7] below.

For those interested in using the full spectrum of the ASCEnD-freePDK45 library, we have a companion project of this, the Pulsar tool, available at https://github.com/marlls1989/pulsar. Pulsar is a push-button synthesis tool that accepts a SystemVerilog or VHDL description and can output the layout of an SDDS-NCL circuit implemented with ASCEnD-freePDK45.

Information about the NCL+ gates, particular templates based on NCL, NCL+ and mixes of these can be found in several of the ASCEnD-freePDK45 authors' publications. A selected list about ASCEnD libraries and about newly proposed asynchronous QDI design templates appear below.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
